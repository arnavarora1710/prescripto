The idea is to build an application that patients and doctors can use.
The application will allow doctors to recommend prescriptions to patients that is personalized
based on their medical history, (allergies, etc.) and the patient's insurance plan.

Java springboot backend:
endpoits:
/
- this is just the home page that launces the react app
/ocr 
- this enpoint will take a base64 encoded image of an insurance card and return the text
/csp
- I wanted this endpoint to be a way of handling the logic of recommenidng prescriptions to patients
Gettning optimal prescription -> Doctor can review/modify -> Send it back to the llm
-> llm generates prescription (can we do this without llm? more deterministic like a constraint satisfication problem?)
-> back to the doctor to review and approve->once doctor approves on the frontend,
they can write notes to each medication.

This goes to the llm again.
The point is for the patients to click on a particular medication and see the reasoning behind why
a particular medication or treatment was recommended.

Possibly say that it was because in the past they mentioned something or whatever.

Right now everything regarding the llm is in the frontend because it was hard to resolve the
dependency issues with the backend.

I want the csp endpoint to be the main endpoint that handles all the logic.

How would you suggest I do this?

Does the idea make sense or can you suggest modifications or improvements?
